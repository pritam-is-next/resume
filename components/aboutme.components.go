	AboutMe: "Hey there! I’m Pritam—a software engineer who thrives on turning creative ideas into precise, functional code. For the past three years, I’ve built all sorts of things, from blazing-fast Go servers to fun C++ game mods, always with a focus on clean, maintainable code. Whether it’s full-stack apps, low-level systems, or open-source tools, I love building solutions that make life easier for developers and users.When I’m not deep in code, you’ll probably find me writing songs, strumming my guitar, or lifting weights at the gym. I’m always up for collaborating on projects that break the mold—let’s build something cool together!",
